The File Handling Utility is a Java application developed to perform basic file operations such as: Creating a file Reading data from a file Writing data into a file Modifying existing file content

This project demonstrates how Java handles text files using built-in file handling classes and exception handling mechanisms. File handling is one of the most important concepts in software development because applications often need to store, retrieve, and update data permanently.

Objective of the Project

The main objectives of this project are:

To understand Java file handling concepts To learn file creation and manipulation To perform read/write operations using Java I/O classes To understand exception handling To develop a reusable text file management utility
